**Project Overview:**
We wanted to build a project that encompasses all that we have been learning in class. We decided on a system that allows users to buy ticket for available upcoming concerts. On our system, users will be able to check for upcoming concerts, see if they are available, reserve a seat, get a discount if they enter the promo code and get a reciept for their purchase. Users can also decide the type of ticket they want, from the options available: `Regular`, `VIP`, `VVIP` and `Table of Ten`.

Using OOP, all our coding was written under a single class, and we created different functions to perform specific tasks. The class takes the name of the user and two dictionaries as arguments. `Loops` and `conditional statments` were extensively used for proper functioning of the code. Also, to catch and  handle exceptions errors in our code, we used 'try' and 'except' statements.



```python
